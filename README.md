# Visualization Anywhere
Virtualization, automation, and cross-domain solutions help a lot in modernize the infrastructure, while introducing unprecedented challenge in operation, as the managed objects explosively grow in quantity, not physically observable, continuously changing with increasing and diverse use cases.

Commercial operation platform doesnâ€™t catch up, and would be costly to develop.

Operation is passive, with the same small operation team to handle the continuously growing complexity.

### How Might We
Help the customer build operation center starting from monitoring for Cisco cross-domain solutions.

### Proposed Solution
Use CNCF open source project to collect different monitoring sources

Monitoring: Grafana, Prometheus, Telegraf

Logging: Fluentd, ELK

Tracing: Jaeger, Open-telemetry

### Import Dashboard Definition in Grafana
The Dashboard is a Cisco ACI visual operation center and metrics should help customers simplify monitoring and operation.
